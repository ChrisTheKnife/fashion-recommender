# Fashion recommernder capstoneproject

## Introduction

Online retailers for fashion products suffer the paradox of choice: With increasing number of articles/choices, customers tend to make less or wrong purchases. This results in less customer satisfaction, more returns and less turnover.
This capstone project deals with the challenging task of creating a recommendation system for a fashion label. This increases customer satisfaction and the sustainability of the sales process, and a targeted recommendation generates significant economic value. In addition, a recommendation system provides valuable insights into customer preferences and forecasting opportunities for stakeholders.
The task is to read customers’ minds without evaluation information based solely on customers’ purchase decisions using cleaver feature engineering and targeted models. An in-depth error analysis was conducted to select an appropriate model, and the winning model was further trained on the proper metric.
In addition to the challenging nature of a recommender system, several additional obstacles were overcome. Starting from a fast adaptation to an unfamiliar subject area, dealing with Big-Data, and targeted feature engineering to acquaint with the yet foreign methodology.
All these efforts were made because “you have the right to look fabulous.”
